    A 1-band Geotiff is written out to disk. This Geotiff contains 1s and 0s. The 1s 
    mark areas of so-called "flood-fill." This is the area that is "filled-in" by the 
    algorithm according to the elevation boundaries of the Digital Elevation Model.

    We can use any common plotting software (e.g. Python, Matlab, QGIS, GrADS, etc.)
    to visualize the output (here we are using's Python 3.x's Matplotlib module.
